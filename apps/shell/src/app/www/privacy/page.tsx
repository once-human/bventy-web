                    At Bventy, we believe in radical transparency. In the spirit of open-source development, we want you to know exactly what data we collect, how we collect it, and why. We do not sell your data. We use telemetry strictly to improve the platform and provide a world-class experience.

                                We use two primary analytics tools to understand how Bventy is used. To ensure we have complete and accurate data to improve our platform, <strong>we actively route this analytics traffic through our own first-party servers (Reverse Proxies)</strong>. This means our tracking scripts are deliberately constructed to bypass browser ad-blockers and privacy shields.

                                    We use Umami for lightweight, privacy-focused dashboarding. Umami is entirely cookieless and does not track you across the broader internet. It simply tells us how many people are visiting our site and which pages are most popular.

                                Building a complex marketplace requires deep insights. If a vendor struggles to upload a portfolio, or if an event planner encounters a broken button, we use session recordings and telemetry to see exactly what went wrong without needing you to write a lengthy bug report. We collect data to make Bventy faster, less buggy, and more intuitive.
